# Project Overview
This project seeks to create a simple Cypress test that will navigate to the [Google](https://www.google.com/) homepage, search for the term "Cypress", and then verify the title of the resulting page. Additionally, this project will document each step taken in this process in order to provide a template for implmenting Cypress tests in future projects.
